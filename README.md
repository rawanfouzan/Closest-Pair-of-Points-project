# Closest Pair of Points in GIS

## Project Overview:
This project solves the Closest Pair of Points problem in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). It compares a Naive Algorithm (Brute Force) and an Optimized Algorithm (Plane Sweep) for finding the closest pair of points efficiently. Applications include emergency response, urban planning, and sensor networks.

## Algorithms Used:
- Naive Algorithm: Compares all pairs of points to find the closest pair. Time complexity: O(n²).
- Optimized Algorithm: Sorts points and uses a vertical line sweep to improve performance. Time complexity: O(n log n).

## Results:
The Naive Algorithm works well for small datasets but becomes inefficient as the dataset size increases. The Optimized Algorithm scales efficiently and maintains performance with larger datasets.

## Group Project:
This is a group project where collaboration was key to solving the Closest Pair of Points problem using both a Naive Algorithm and an Optimized Algorithm.
