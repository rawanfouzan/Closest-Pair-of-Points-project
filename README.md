# Closest-Pair-of-Points-project
This project solves the Closest Pair of Points problem in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). It compares a Naive Algorithm (Brute Force) and an Optimized Algorithm (Plane Sweep) for efficiency in finding the closest pair. The project highlights real-world GIS applications like emergency response and urban planning.
